# Bandwidth-Optimization-in-Portable-Pabx-System

Optimize in bandwidth varying category: 
This is a portable Pbx bandwidth optimization pattern for high or low end users. Elastix unified communication engine is used and different algorithmic schemes are used with different data structure to see buffer, jitter problems and also perfomance through the wireless network nodes.
